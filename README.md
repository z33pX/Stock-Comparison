# Stock-Price-Comparison

This little piece of code is just for comparing the returns of stocks :)

In `main.py` you can find this line of code:
```
symbols = ['TSLA', 'MSFT', 'AAPL', 'GOOG', 'AMZN', 'NFLX']
```
Change the symbols to what ever you want. By editing the `start = '20170101'` variable you can
define the start date.

And if you want to change the colors just edit this:

```
colors_set = ['#de5700', '#00de1d', '#f600ff', '#00decc', '#ffba00',
              '#b7de00', '#b700de', '#4700de', '#0081de', '#de0000']
```
Here are some results:
